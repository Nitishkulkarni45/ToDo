# ToDo
## This app has a basic function as that of a normal To-Do list application but in addition to it, I was successful in adding some features to it.

1) In the beginning along with allocation of the task user must also specify the date by which he/she is going to complete the task. Then only the user can add the task else he/she is not permitted to add the task without mentioning the deadline for the task.
2) In case the user enters the wrong deadline or the past date then also an alert message pops up indicating that the entered date is invalid.
3) The date entered by the user for the completion of the task should be such that the date should be of the future.
4) Another interesting feature of this is that the list that is made will not get vanished on reloading the page. That is it is stored in the local storage.
